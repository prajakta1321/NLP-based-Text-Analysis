# NLP-based-Text-Analysis
 
Text analysis (TA) is a machine learning technique used to automatically extract valuable insights from unstructured text data.

TA is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is an application area within NLP, focusing on the analysis, interpretation, and extraction of meaningful information from textual data.


 

This repository contains basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques used for practicing key concepts like text extraction, tokenization, clustering, and classification.

***Techniques Practiced***

***K-Means Clustering:***

Applied for unsupervised grouping of similar text data.

***Multinomial Naive Bayes:***

Used for classifying text into different categories.

***Text Processing:***

Includes tokenization, feature extraction (Bag of Words, TF-IDF), and basic text analysis functions.
Purpose

This repository serves as a practice space for implementing and refining foundational NLP techniques on a sample dataset.
